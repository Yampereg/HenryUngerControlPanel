List all FILMS mentioned in this Hebrew lecture.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Output film titles in ENGLISH only (e.g., "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Moonrise Kingdom")
2. Real films only - no fictional films
3. Only if 100% certain - skip if unsure
4. Write full film title in English
5. Include if the context makes clear it is a film (e.g. the lecture discusses the director, cinematography, or story as a film).
   In a film lecture, a title mentioned in film context is likely a film — include it.
   Do NOT include TV shows, books, or plays.
   Film titles may appear in Hebrew (translated or transliterated) — recognize and output the English title.
