List all FILMS mentioned in this Hebrew lecture.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Output film titles in ENGLISH only (e.g., "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Moonrise Kingdom")
2. Real films only - no fictional films
3. Only if 100% certain - skip if unsure
4. Write full film title in English
5. Include if the context makes clear it is a film (e.g. the lecture discusses the director, cinematography, or story as a film).
   In a film lecture, a title mentioned in film context is likely a film — include it.
   Do NOT include TV shows, books, or plays.
   Film titles may appear in Hebrew (translated or transliterated) — recognize and output the English title.

⛔ IMPORTANT — FILMS VS. BOOKS:
   Many works exist both as a book AND as a film adaptation.
   Include a title in this list ONLY if it was mentioned specifically AS A FILM — meaning the lecturer refers to it as a movie, discusses its cinematography, director, scenes, or visual/cinematic aspects.
   If the same title was discussed as a novel, book, or literary work — do NOT include it here, even if a film adaptation exists.
   When in doubt whether it was referenced as a film or as a book — do NOT include it.

Separate into:
- DISCUSSED: Film is one of the main subjects of the lecture — the lecturer analyzes it in depth, describes scenes, or it is projected and discussed on screen
- MENTIONED: Film is brought up briefly as a reference, comparison, or example — if in doubt, use MENTIONED

Return as plain text with ENGLISH titles (separate with semicolons — do NOT use commas, as film titles may contain commas):
DISCUSSED: Film 1; Film 2
MENTIONED: Film 3; Film 4

If none, write "DISCUSSED: none" or "MENTIONED: none"
