List all PHILOSOPHERS, INTELLECTUALS, and THEORISTS mentioned in this Hebrew lecture.

✅ INCLUDE — people primarily known as thinkers, not creative artists:
- Classical & modern philosophers: Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein
- Contemporary philosophers & theorists: Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, Baudrillard, Žižek, Benjamin
- Film theorists & critics (academic): André Bazin, Siegfried Kracauer, Laura Mulvey, Roland Barthes
- Cultural theorists: Susan Sontag, Adorno, Gramsci, Bourdieu
- Psychoanalytic thinkers: Freud, Lacan, Winnicott
- Any named intellectual, academic, or cultural critic — whose primary identity is as a THINKER

⚠️ DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Film directors (even if they have theoretical ideas — put them in directors)
- Writers, novelists, or poets (even if philosophical — put them in writers)
- Artists/painters (put them in painters)
- Poets (even if they wrote philosophical poetry — they belong in writers)
- Screenwriters
- Anyone whose primary identity is as a creative artist rather than a thinker
- People you assume are relevant but are NOT explicitly named in the transcript

RULES:
1. Output in ENGLISH only (standard Western spelling)
2. Full names only
3. ONLY if the person is explicitly named in the transcript
4. Skip if unsure — when in doubt between philosopher and writer/poet, put them in writers
5. ⛔ STRICT RULE — Only include people whose PRIMARY public identity is as a philosopher, theorist, or intellectual.
   If someone is mainly known as a novelist, playwright, or poet — even if they also wrote philosophical essays or had philosophical ideas — do NOT include them here. Put them in writers.
   Examples of people who belong in WRITERS, not here: Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre (primarily novelist/playwright), Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, Simone de Beauvoir (if discussed as a novelist), etc.
   When uncertain, default to writers — only philosophers known first and foremost as thinkers belong in this list.

Separate into:
- DISCUSSED: Philosopher/thinker is one of the main subjects of the lecture — their ideas, theories, or texts are analyzed in depth
- MENTIONED: Philosopher/thinker is brought up briefly as a reference or comparison — if in doubt, use MENTIONED

Return as plain text in ENGLISH (separate with semicolons — do NOT use commas, as names may contain commas):
DISCUSSED: Philosopher 1; Philosopher 2
MENTIONED: Philosopher 3; Philosopher 4

If none, write "DISCUSSED: none" or "MENTIONED: none"
