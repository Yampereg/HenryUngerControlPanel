Extract ALL entities mentioned in this Hebrew lecture transcript.
Return a JSON object with exactly the following structure — no extra keys, no markdown fences.

Rules per category:
- directors:    Film directors explicitly named (English names only, not writers/philosophers)
- films:        Film titles explicitly mentioned (English titles only, real films)
- writers:      Literary authors/novelists/poets/playwrights explicitly named (English)
- books:        Book/literary work titles explicitly mentioned (English or Hebrew)
- painters:     Visual artists (painters, sculptors) explicitly named (English or Hebrew)
- paintings:    Specific artwork titles explicitly mentioned (Hebrew preferred)
- philosophers: Philosophers and major intellectual figures explicitly named (English)
- themes:       Exactly 10 broad academic/philosophical themes from the lecture (Hebrew)

For each category use two lists:
  "discussed" — main subjects of the lecture
  "mentioned" — referenced briefly or in passing

CRITICAL: Only include entities EXPLICITLY NAMED in the transcript. No guessing or inference.
Names may appear in Hebrew transliteration — output in the standard English form.

Return ONLY valid JSON, nothing else:
