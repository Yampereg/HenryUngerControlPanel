Extract ALL entities mentioned in this Hebrew lecture transcript.
Return a JSON object with exactly the following structure — no extra keys, no markdown fences.

Rules per category:
- directors:    Film directors explicitly named — full names only, English, not writers/philosophers
- films:        Film titles explicitly mentioned — English titles only, real films.
                ⛔ Only include if mentioned AS A FILM (cinematography, director, scenes discussed).
                Do NOT include if the same title was discussed as a novel/book — even if a film adaptation exists.
- writers:      Literary authors/novelists/poets/playwrights explicitly named — full names only, English
- books:        Book/literary work titles explicitly mentioned (English or Hebrew)
- painters:     Visual artists (painters, sculptors) explicitly named — full names only (English or Hebrew)
- paintings:    Specific artwork titles explicitly mentioned (Hebrew preferred)
- philosophers: Philosophers and intellectuals explicitly named — full names only, English.
                NOT poets, novelists, or film directors. Only people whose PRIMARY identity is as a thinker.
                ⛔ If someone is mainly known as a novelist/playwright (e.g. Camus, Sartre, Kafka, Beckett) — put them in writers, not here.
- themes:       Exactly 10 broad academic/philosophical themes from the lecture (Hebrew)

For each category use two lists:
  "discussed" — main subjects of the lecture
  "mentioned" — referenced briefly or in passing

CRITICAL: Only include entities EXPLICITLY NAMED in the transcript. No guessing or inference.
Full names only — do not return last names alone (e.g. "Franz Kafka" not "Kafka", "Wes Anderson" not "Anderson").
Names may appear in Hebrew transliteration — output in the standard English form.

Return ONLY valid JSON, nothing else:
